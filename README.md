# Introduction
Tergum is a UI for manging Restic backups across multiple servers by deploying *agents* to each server of interest. The goal is to have a central place to interact with everything Restic.

# Why?
No grand reason; a friend of mine asked if there was a UI for it, and a quick search didn't turn much up on it.
I was personally interested in this as my own setup uses multiple VMs to seperate some of my things, but I'm intersted in having constent backups on all of them.

And another project to potentially learn something is always enough to trigger me, even if it's just another project for the personal pile.

# Following development
While the repo is public I'm still only developing on it myself, and afterwards welcome any PRs that might come.
Feel free to open issues labeled as `enhancement` if you have any idea you want added or want to add yourself, but checkout the planned features below.
